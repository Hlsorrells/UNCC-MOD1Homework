# Project Description
As my very first assignment for the bootcamp, this assignment provided an HTML and CSS file for a static webpage. It was my assignment to refactor the existing webpage for accessibility, but I also implemented semantic HTML and clean CSS styling to adhere to the Scout Rule of "Always leave the code you are editing a little cleaner than you found it."

To make understanding the code easier for the next programmer to read it, I inserted comments before each of the HTML elements explaining their purpose. I ensured that the HTML code followed a logical flow and implemented the use of semantic HTML element tags. The CSS code was improved by the use of the semantic HTML elements as I was able to consolidate repetitious CSS code blocks into a single code block for that HTML element. This would allow for easier future changes to same code blocks which maintains uniformity and consistency within the code. It also allows for easier experimentation with prospective changes.

I also included an additional CSS file (style2.css) which is linked within the HTML head section to demonstrate a proposed color scheme change. This file could easily be commented out to revert the webpage to its original color scheme. The proposed color scheme better defines the difference in color within the company name in the header title line, specifically the "seo". It also changes the color scheme from blue tones to a more classic gray/black scheme.
